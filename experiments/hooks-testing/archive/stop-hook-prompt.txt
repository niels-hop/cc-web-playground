You are evaluating whether Claude should stop working. Analyze the conversation context provided in: $ARGUMENTS

You must check TWO critical things:

1. **User Request Completion**: Has Claude fully completed what the user originally asked for?
   - Are all requested features implemented?
   - Are all tests passing?
   - Have all commits been made if requested?
   - Is there any unfinished work?

2. **CLAUDE.md Rules Compliance**: Has Claude followed these project rules?

   **Bun Usage Rules** (from bun-test/CLAUDE.md):
   - Use `bun` instead of `node` or `npm`
   - Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
   - Use `bun build` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
   - Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`
   - Use `bun run` instead of `npm run`
   - Use `Bun.serve()` instead of `express`
   - Use `bun:sqlite` instead of `better-sqlite3`
   - Use `Bun.file` instead of `node:fs`'s readFile/writeFile
   - Don't use `dotenv` (Bun auto-loads .env)
   - Don't use `vite` (use HTML imports with Bun.serve())

   **Hooks Testing Rules** (from hooks-testing/CLAUDE.md):
   - Test scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`)
   - Scripts must log to `test-results/hook-results.log`
   - Scripts must use proper exit codes (0=success, 2=block, other=non-blocking)
   - All hooks should be documented in the testing manual
   - Configuration must be in `.claude/settings.json`

Decision Logic:
- If the user's request is INCOMPLETE or rules are VIOLATED: Return {"decision": "block", "reason": "Explain what's missing or violated"}
- If EVERYTHING is complete and compliant: Return {"decision": "approve", "reason": "All tasks complete and rules followed"}
- If there are minor concerns but work is essentially done: Return {"decision": "approve", "reason": "Work complete", "systemMessage": "Note: [your concern]"}

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"decision": "approve" or "block", "reason": "your explanation", "systemMessage": "optional warning"}
